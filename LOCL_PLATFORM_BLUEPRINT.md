## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Opportunity
Restaurants are bleeding 25-30% in fees to DoorDash, Uber Eats, and GrubHub. Home-based businesses have no modern solution. Small local shops can't compete with big tech platforms. **LOCL is the answer.**

### The Solution
LOCL is a **white-label, customizable ordering & delivery platform** that restaurants, convenience stores, home-based businesses, and makers can deploy instantly with:
- **Zero per-order fees** (only setup + optional monthly support)
- **Full customer data ownership** (no platform middleman)
- **Real-time delivery management** (use your own drivers)
- **Built-in loyalty & marketing tools**
- **Live order tracking & fulfillment visibility**

### The Vision
Position LOCL as the **"Operating System for Local Businesses"** — the anti-corporate, high-margin alternative to delivery platforms that takes 30% of every order.

### The Business Model
1. **High One-Time Setup Fee** ($297 - $1,499)
2. **Low/Optional Monthly Hosting** ($0 - $299/month)
3. **Support Tier Upsell** (Email, Phone, Training)
4. **No per-order fees ever** (we succeed when restaurants succeed)

**Why This Works:** Restaurants make more money → they invest in more features → they refer other restaurants.

**Annual Cost (Year 2+):** **$1,188/year**

**Average Restaurant Saves:** If making $10k/month in delivery sales:
- **DoorDash Cost:** 30% = $3,000/month = **$36,000/year**
- **LOCL Cost:** $99/month = **$1,188/year**
- **Annual Savings:** **$34,812** (96% reduction)

- **Current DoorDash Cost:** $50k/month in delivery sales × 30% = **$180,000/year**
- **LOCL Cost:** $299/month = **$3,588/year**

**Example Economics:**

- For every restaurant paying $99/month, you earn $30-40/month recurring

**Target Customer:** 50+ agency partners by end of Year 1

---

### REVENUE MODEL EXAMPLE (Year 1, Virginia Only)

- 5% choose Reseller tier (custom)

**Year 1 Revenue Projection:**

|------|-----------|-----------|---|---|
| Starter | 100 | $29,700 | $0 | $29,700 |
| Partner | 300 | $209,700 | $35,640 | $245,340 |
| Agency | 75 | $112,425 | $26,910 | $139,335 |
| Reseller | 25 | $49,975 | Varies | $49,975 |
| **TOTAL** | **500** | **$402,000** | **$62,550+** | **$464,550+** |

**Year 2 Revenue Projection (with growth):**
- 1,200 cumulative customers (240% growth)

### FEATURE FLAG ARCHITECTURE

In Firestore, a single `featureFlags` collection determines which UI components render:

```javascript
// In Firestore: /businesses/{businessId}/config/featureFlags
{
  businessType: 'restaurant', // determines what features are available
  features: {
    // Core Features (all tiers)
    ordering: true,
    paymentProcessing: true,
    customerNotifications: true,
    
    // Partner Tier+
    liveOrderTracking: true,
    driverManagement: true,
    analyticsBasic: true,
    loyaltyProgram: true,
    
    // Agency Tier+
    liveStreaming: true,
    batchRouting: true,
    advancedAnalytics: true,
    apiAccess: true,
    customIntegrations: true,
    
    // Business Type Specific
    kitchenDisplaySystem: businessType === 'restaurant',
    fulfillmentWorkflow: businessType === 'home_bakery' || businessType === 'crafter',
    subscriptionManagement: businessType === 'meal_prep' || businessType === 'farm_csa',
    customizationFields: businessType === 'crafter',
    batchDeliveryRouting: businessType === 'home_bakery' || businessType === 'meal_prep',
    cottageLawLabels: businessType === 'home_bakery' || businessType === 'farm_csa',
  }
}
```

This allows us to **run a single codebase** but show different features based on tier and business type.

  - Yelp

## 9. HOME BUSINESS & MAKER FEATURES

### "MAKER MODE" FEATURE SET

This is the product differentiation that opens up a massive new market.

#### Feature 1: Fulfillment Workflow Dashboard
Instead of "Kitchen Display System," makers see:

```
[ORDER #204 - Sarah's Custom Tumbler]
Customer: John Smith
Items:
  - 20oz Stainless Tumbler (Teal) x1
  - "HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM" engraving
  - Gift wrap (+$2)

Status Timeline:
  [✓] Order confirmed (2:34 PM)
  [→] Design approved by customer (ready to print)
  [ ] Engraving in progress
  [ ] Quality check
  [ ] Packing
  [ ] Ready for pickup

Timer: 45 min (customer paid for 60 min)
[START FULFILLMENT] [PAUSE] [READY FOR PICKUP]
```

**Why This Matters:** Makers need to track *steps*, not just "preparing" status.

---

#### Feature 2: Live Prep/Packing Livestream

**How It Works:**
1. Baker gets an order at 9 AM for 20 cookies
2. Baker taps "Go Live" in LOCL app
3. System generates a unique 30-minute livestream link
4. Customer gets SMS: "Watch Sarah bake your cookies! [LINK]"
5. Customer can see the actual baking process
6. After 30 min, link expires (customer can't rewind, can't screen record — builds urgency)

**Why This Wins:**
- Builds trust (they see it's being made fresh)
- Creates viral marketing (customers share on Instagram/TikTok)
- Justifies premium pricing ("You saw me make it!")
- Increases perceived value (people pay more for artisanal feel)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Integration with Twitch or Mux.com
- Automatic quality detection (turns off stream if connection drops)
- Analytics: "Your 'Go Live' got 47 views, 12 shares"

---

#### Feature 3: Batch Delivery Routing

**Scenario:**
A home baker has 25 orders all due "Saturday delivery." Without routing optimization, she drives 2 hours. With LOCL:

```
[BATCH ROUTE OPTIMIZER]
Orders to deliver: 25
Total time (optimized): 47 minutes
Miles: 12.3
Est. fuel cost: $2.15

Suggested Route:
  1. 123 Elm St (Order #201) → ETA 9:05 AM
  2. 456 Oak Ave (Order #198, #203) → ETA 9:18 AM
  3. 789 Pine Rd (Order #199) → ETA 9:28 AM
  ...

[ACCEPT ROUTE] [ADJUST MANUALLY] [EXPORT TO MAPS]
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Time = money. Saving 1 hour per week = 52 hours/year
- Lower fuel costs (optimize not via miles, but via time)
- Reduce order misdeliveries (route tells you exact sequence)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Mapbox Optimization API (already in our stack)
- OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) for fallback
- Real-time re-optimization if a customer cancels

---

#### Feature 4: Customization Fields

Makers often need to collect info from customers:

```
[CUSTOMIZE YOUR ORDER]

Tumbler Size:
  ○ 16oz
  ○ 20oz ← SELECTED
  ○ 30oz

Color:
  ○ Black
  ○ Teal ← SELECTED
  ○ Rose Gold
  ○ Silver

Text (20 chars max):
  [HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD____] ← ENTERED

Font Style:
  ○ Sans-Serif
  ○ Serif ← SELECTED
  ○ Cursive

Gift Wrap?
  ☐ No (+$0)
  ☑ Yes (+$3) ← CHECKED

Add a special message (optional):
  [Please make this perfect!___________]
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Eliminates confusion ("Did I order the blue one or teal?")
- Prints directly to fulfillment dashboard
- Can auto-generate label or print-to-order slip

**Technical Implementation:**
- Dynamic form builder (drag-and-drop in admin panel)
- Conditional fields ("If color = custom, show RGB picker")
- Stored with order in Firestore

---

#### Feature 5: Cottage Law Compliance Labels

Many home bakers/farmers operate under "Cottage Food Operation" laws in Virginia, which require:
- Ingredient list
- Allergen warnings
- "Made in a home kitchen" disclaimer
- Expiration date

LOCL auto-generates printable labels:

```
[AUTO-GENERATE LABEL]

Business Name: Sarah's Sunrise Cookies
Product: Chocolate Chip Cookies
Date Made: 2026-02-02
Expiration: 2026-02-09

INGREDIENTS:
Flour, butter, sugar, eggs, vanilla, chocolate chips, sea salt

ALLERGENS: Contains eggs, wheat, dairy
CROSS-CONTAMINATION: Made in a facility with nuts, soy

Made in a home kitchen that is not subject to state licensing or inspection.

Produced: Sarah's Sunrise
Contact: 804-555-1234

[PRINT (4x3")]  [EMAIL TO CUSTOMER]
```

---

#### Feature 6: Subscription Management

For meal prep services and recurring orders:

```
[SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT]

Customer: Jane Doe
Active Subscriptions:
  → Weekly Meal Prep (Monday delivery) - $85/week
  → Coffee Subscription (Friday delivery) - $25/week

Next Orders:
  Feb 3 (Mon): Meal Prep Box #128
  Feb 7 (Fri): Medium Roast Coffee x2

Jane's Pause History:
  - Paused: Jan 13-20 (1 week)
  - Reason: "On vacation"

[EDIT] [PAUSE NEXT WEEK] [CANCEL]
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Recurring revenue = predictability
- Customers often forget to re-order, leaving money on table
- Automatic billing reduces admin work

---

### "MAKER" LANDING PAGE CONTENT

**URL:** `/for-makers`

**Hero Section:**
> "Sell Your Crafts. Own Your Customers.
> 
> No Etsy fees. No Shopify complexity. Just you and your creations."

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Etsy takes 6.5% + payment processing, plus you can't reach customers directly
- Shopify is $29/month minimum + complexity
- Wix/Square Online don't handle local delivery logistics
- No tool lets customers watch you make their custom order

**Features Highlighted:**
1. **Custom Fields** (monograms, sizes, colors)
2. **Live Packing Livestream** (viral trust builder)
3. **Local Delivery Only** (no shipping logistics)
4. **Direct Customer Contact** (SMS/email marketing)
5. **Batch Route Optimization** (save delivery time)

**Pricing for Makers:**
- Same as Partner tier ($699 setup + $99/month)
- But with messaging that emphasizes: "No marketplace middleman"

## APPENDIX A: QUESTIONS FOR USER VALIDATION

Before full implementation, get user feedback on:

1. **Pricing Sensitivity**
   - Would you pay $699 setup + $99/month to save $3,000/month in fees?
   - Is $1,499 for Agency tier reasonable for chains?

2. **Feature Priority**
   - Is real-time driver tracking more important than KDS?
   - Do you need batch delivery routing immediately, or can it wait?
   - How important is the loyalty program?

3. **Go-To-Market**
   - Should we start with direct sales to restaurants, or agency partnerships?
   - Which Virginia city should we target first (Richmond, Arlington, Petersburg)?
   - What sales channels work best? (LinkedIn, local events, referrals, cold email)

4. **Support Model**
   - Should we offer free onboarding calls, or charge for setup?
   - How much training do restaurants typically need?
