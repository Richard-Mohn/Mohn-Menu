## Beating ChowNow at Their Own Game (2026)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - THE NEW MODEL

**The Revolution:** Zero-commission delivery platform with freemium pricing that undercuts ChowNow by 50%+ while offering superior features.

**Core Strategy:**
- **FREE tier** - Zero barrier to entry (vs ChowNow's $119-499 setup fee)
- **Premium tiers** - $79-299/mo (vs ChowNow's ~$199-399/mo + transaction fees)

2. No transaction fees (ChowNow charges 2.95% + $0.29)
3. Free tier to test (ChowNow requires payment upfront)
4. Better driver marketplace pricing (explained below)

## CHOWNOW COMPLETE PRICING BREAKDOWN (2026)

### ChowNow's Tier Structure

ChowNow has 3 main tiers: **Hub**, **Pro**, and **Premier**

#### Tier Pricing (Estimated - ChowNow doesn't publicly list)
- **Hub:** ~$119-149/month (entry tier)
- **Pro:** ~$199-299/month (most popular)
- **Premier:** ~$399-599/month (enterprise)

### ChowNow's Universal Fees (ALL TIERS)

**Setup Fee:** $119 - $499 one-time
- Varies by market and sales negotiation
- Required before you can start taking orders

**Transaction Fees:** 2.95% + $0.29 per order
- Applied to EVERY order
- This is the hidden cost that adds up

**Example Math:**
- Restaurant does $10,000/month in online orders
- Average order: $35
- Number of orders: ~286 orders/month
- Transaction fees: ($10,000 × 2.95%) + (286 × $0.29) = $295 + $83 = **$378/month**

### ChowNow Flex Delivery (Their Driver Network)

**How It Works:**
- ChowNow partners with DoorDash and Uber for delivery
- Flat delivery fee: **$7.98 per order** (up to 8 miles)
- ChowNow recommends splitting this cost:
  - Restaurant pays: $3.99
  - Customer pays: $3.99
- If restaurant covers the full $7.98, they absorb the cost

**Important Notes:**
- In California, NYC, and Seattle: Delivery fees are HIGHER due to regional regulations (as of June 11, 2024)
- ChowNow claims splitting costs 50/50 can increase delivery orders by 2x

**The Real Cost:**
- Restaurant doing 100 deliveries/month
- If covering half the cost: 100 × $3.99 = **$399/month**
- If covering full cost: 100 × $7.98 = **$798/month**

### 📱 Consumer Marketplace App Listing (FREE on Growth+)

**What It Is:** The "LOCL" consumer-facing marketplace app (like ChowNow App)

**How It Works:**
- Customers download "LOCL" app
- Browse all local restaurants using LOCL
- Order from any restaurant
- Restaurants get discovered by new customers

**Commission Structure:**
- Orders from merchant's own website: **0% commission**
- Orders from LOCL marketplace app: **8% commission**

**Comparison:**
- Uber Eats: 30% commission
- DoorDash: 30% commission
- ChowNow App: Free listing (included)
- **LOCL App: Free listing + only 8% if order comes through app (vs 30%)**

**Why This Works:**

## THE CHOWNOW FLEX DELIVERY DEEP DIVE

### How ChowNow's Flex Delivery Actually Works

**The Setup:**
- ChowNow partners with DoorDash and Uber for last-mile delivery
- Restaurant doesn't need to hire drivers
- Orders automatically go to nearest available DoorDash/Uber driver

**The Pricing:**
- **Base cost: $7.98 per delivery** (up to 8 miles)
- ChowNow recommends 50/50 split:
  - Restaurant pays: $3.99
  - Customer pays: $3.99 (added to their checkout total)

**Regional Surcharges (as of June 11, 2024):**
- **California:** Higher fees due to Prop 22 regulations
- **New York City:** Higher fees due to minimum wage laws for delivery workers
- **Seattle:** Higher fees due to PayUp ordinance
- Exact amounts not disclosed but estimated 20-40% higher

**ChowNow's Data Claim:**
- When restaurants split the cost 50/50, delivery orders can increase by 2x
- Logic: $3.99 delivery fee is palatable to customers (vs $7.98 full cost)

### LOCL's Driver Marketplace vs ChowNow Flex

**LOCL Pricing:**
- **$3.50 per delivery OR 10% of order value (whichever is less)**
- Example: $50 order → $3.50 (not $5)
- Example: $25 order → $2.50 (10% is less than $3.50)

**Why LOCL Is Better:**
- ✅ Cheaper on high-value orders (percentage cap)
- ✅ Built-in GPS tracking (ChowNow's Flex doesn't show driver location to merchant)
- ✅ Local driver pool (not relying on Uber/DoorDash surge pricing)
- ✅ No regional surcharges (we control pricing)

**The Strategy:**
- Start with in-house drivers (0% fee)
- Use LOCL marketplace as backup ($3.50 per delivery)
- Compare to ChowNow's mandatory $3.99-7.98
- Restaurant has flexibility (ChowNow forces Flex if you want delivery)

## THE SALES PITCH (EXACT SCRIPTS)

### For Restaurants Currently on ChowNow

**Opening:**
"Hey [Name], I saw you're using ChowNow. How's it working out for you?"

**[They say it's fine but expensive]**

"What are you paying monthly? Around $200 plus transaction fees?"

**[They confirm ~$200/mo + fees]**

"Okay, so with transaction fees, you're probably around $500-600 a month, right? Here's why I'm here: I built a platform that does everything ChowNow does, but it's $149 a month flat. No transaction fees. No setup fee. You'd save about $400-500 every month."

**[Objection: "But ChowNow has the marketplace app"]**

"We have that too. LOCL App—same concept. Your restaurant shows up for local customers. But here's the difference: ChowNow takes no commission on those orders, and neither do we. But we also don't charge you 3% on every direct order. So you're winning both ways."

**[Objection: "What about delivery? ChowNow has Flex"]**

"We have the same thing, but cheaper. ChowNow Flex is $3.99-7.98 per delivery, right? We're $3.50 flat, and on big orders it's even less because we cap at 10%. Plus—and this is huge—we have live driver tracking. Your customers can see exactly where the driver is, just like Uber Eats. ChowNow doesn't have that."

**[Show live tracking demo on phone]**

"See this? That's your customer's view. The driver is moving in real-time. ChowNow can't do that. And you're saving $400 a month."

**[Close]**

"Look, when's your ChowNow contract up? [Note it] Perfect. Let's get you set up on LOCL now—it's free to start—and you can run both in parallel. When you see how much you're saving, you drop ChowNow. No risk. Deal?"

---

### For Restaurants Using Uber Eats/DoorDash Only

**Opening:**
"Hey [Name], quick question: are you using Uber Eats or DoorDash for delivery?"

**[They say yes, Uber Eats]**

"Got it. What percentage are they taking? 25-30%?"

**[They confirm]**

"Ouch. So on a $1,000 night, you're giving them $250-300. That's brutal. Here's the thing: what if I told you there's a way to keep that $250 and still offer delivery?"

**[Interest piqued]**

"It's called LOCL. Zero commission. Zero setup fee. You can start free right now. If you have your own driver, great—use them for free. If you need a backup driver, we have a network. It's $3.50 per delivery instead of 30% of the whole order. On a $40 order, that's $3.50 instead of $12. You just saved $8.50."

**[Objection: "But Uber Eats gets me customers"]**

"I hear you. But here's the reality: those aren't YOUR customers—they're Uber's. If Uber raises their commission to 35% next year (and they might), you're stuck. With LOCL, every customer goes into YOUR database. You can text them, email them, bring them back for free. Plus, we're building a LOCL marketplace app too, so you get discovery AND you keep your customers."

**[Objection: "I'm locked into a contract"]**

"No worries. Start LOCL now for your website orders. Keep Uber Eats for the app orders. We can even pull those Uber Eats orders into your LOCL dashboard so you only have one screen to look at. Then when your contract's up, you drop Uber."

**[Close]**

"It's free to start. I'll set it up this week. You literally lose nothing. Want to try it?"

---

### For Restaurants with NO Online Ordering

**Opening:**
"Hey [Name], do you take online orders or just phone orders?"

**[Phone only]**

"Got it. Can I ask—do you ever miss calls during rush hour?"

**[Yes, constantly]**

"Right. You're losing money. Every missed call is $30-40 gone. Here's the fix: online ordering. But here's the problem—Uber Eats and DoorDash will rob you blind. 30% commission. ChowNow is better but still expensive ($200-500/month)."

"So I built LOCL. It's free to start. Zero setup fee. You can take pickup orders right away, no cost. When you're ready to add delivery, it's $79 a month. Not $79 per order—$79 total. And zero commission."

**[Objection: "I don't know how to set that up"]**

"I'll do it for you. Takes me 10 minutes. I'll import your menu, set up your website, and show you how to use the dashboard. Free. If you hate it, delete it. But I bet you'll love keeping 100% of your money."

**[Close]**

"Let's do it. Give me your menu and 10 minutes. You'll be taking online orders by tomorrow."
