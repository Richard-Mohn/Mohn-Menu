              <p className="mb-4">
                MohnMenu&apos;s core ordering platform is provided free of charge with zero commission on orders. Our revenue model is based on optional premium module subscriptions:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-2">
                <li><strong>Starter Plan (Free):</strong> Core ordering, menu management, QR ordering, basic analytics, and standard payment processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Growth Plan ($47/month):</strong> Includes GPS fleet tracking, Chef&apos;s Eye live streaming, advanced analytics, Google ordering integration, and priority support.</li>
                <li><strong>Enterprise Plan (Custom):</strong> Multi-location management, API access, custom integrations, dedicated account manager, and white-label options.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Payment processing fees (e.g., Stripe&apos;s 2.9% + 30&cent;) are charged by the respective payment processor and are separate from MohnMenu&apos;s subscription pricing. Cryptocurrency transaction fees are determined by the blockchain network and NOWPayments.

              <p>
                Premium modules are billed on a month-to-month basis. There are no long-term contracts, no lock-in periods, and no cancellation fees. You may cancel any premium module at any time from your dashboard settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period, and you will retain access to premium features until that date. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods.
